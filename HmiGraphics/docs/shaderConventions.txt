Conventions for shaders:

- no deprecated variables is the goal: no gl_Vertex, gl_Normal, gl_MultiTexCoord etc.
- This also applies to unioforms: no gl_ModelViewMatrix

replacemens for the "standard" variables from OGL 2.1, (The original names are still available from  the "compatibity profile"):

Old name             New attribute
gl_Vertex            mcPosition               (note: mc denotes "model coordinates"; you also have "ec" for "eye coordinates" like in ecPosition etc)
gl_Normal            mcNormal
gl_Color             color
gl_SecondaryColor    secondaryColor
gl_MultiTexCoordn    texCoordn              (n = 0, 1, 2, ....) in OpenGL this would have GL_TEXTURE0, etc...
gl_FogCoord          fogCoord


GLSL attribute index conventions

POSITION  : 0
NORMAL    : 1
TANGENT   : 2
TEXCOORD0 : 3
TEXCOORD1 : 4
TEXCOORD2 : 5
TEXCOORD3 : 6
COLOR     : 7
SECONDARYCOLOR : 8

glGetAttribLocation versus glBindAttribLocation:  the former queries the shader
for the attribute locations. This implies that GLMesh needs the shaderId, in order to
do these queries. the latter required a "fixed" assignment of location when compiling (and before linking)
the shader.

Some remarks/comments on the structure of woman23.dae


*) The geometry consists on one set of vertices, two triangle meshes, each with its own material. One for the body, one for the head.
*) The mesh uses weight blending for mesh deformation. The skeleton (a controller in Collada) and the mesh are two separate branches
within the Collada scenegrap. 
* The mesh itself is a node with id=CWom0023-Mesh-node (no transform)
* The skeleton is a child of the root with id=CWom0023-Bip-node.
* The skeleton root itself has id=CWom0023-Pelvis-node. This will become joint[0] within the scenegraph
* The natural position of the mesh is as follows:  "up" is in the +Z-direction, nose is pointing in the -Y direction.
  (So, with the standard OpenGL viewer, the avatar lies down on her nose, head in the +Z direction.
  This is in accordance with the Collada line that say: <up_axis>Z_UP</up_axis>
* The natural bind pose is the T-shape model.
* When no transformations are performed (forced inside the GLSkinnedMesh rendering), the avatar lies along the +Z axis, nose down, T-shape pose.
* The joint matrices (specified via the Collada (skeleton-) nodes and the inverse bind matrices more or less cancel. 
  So the joint positions can be determined either from the joint matrices, or via the inverse bind matrices. 
  For some reason some of the joint matrices are, for instance, 180 degree turns, 
  whereas the corresponding inverse bind matrices are 178.8 degree turns,
  so they do not cancel perfectly. The result (after multiplying them together) is a netto rotation of +- 1.7 degrees on some body parts. 
  Unclear whether this is the result of roundoff errors etcetera, or whethere there is a slight mistake in either the joint matrices or the inverse bind matrices.
* addition: when both the inverse bind matrices and the joint matrices are used, the position of the joint centeres (calculated via the joint nodes)
  matches the correct position in the mesh. With combined tranform disabled (inside the render process), they do NOT match perfectly. In particular,
  the finger joint markers end up outside the finger mesh.
* The rotations inside the skeleton ( so disregarding inverse bind matrices) are somewhat strange. Except for "numerical errors" etc.
the first few matrices are as follows:
 Bip  (not part of the skeleton, but the root on the transform chain)
  0  1  0  0
 -1  0  0  0
  0  0  1  0.9
  0  0  0  1
  
  This is a rotation of -90 degrees around the Z axis. 
  
  Pelvis:
  0  1  0  0
  0  0  1  0
  1  0  0  0
  0  0  0  1
  This is a rotation of -120 degrees around (1,1,1) Alternatively, it exchanges x->z->y->x in a circular fashion
  
  Bip o Pelvis =
   0  0  1  0
   0 -1  0  0
   1  0  0  0.9
   0  0  0  1
   
   This ia a rotation of 180 degrees around (1, 0, 1)
   The effect of this combination would be to have the avatar lying along the X-axis, nose in the +Y direction. 
   Indeed all node matrices along the spine specify translations in the X-direction.  
   
 It is possible to reset the bip node as well as the pelvis node to identity matrices (no rotation, no translation),
 without distorting the final avatar rendering. In this case the avatar lies on her back, aligned with the X-axis, head in
 the direction of the positive X-axis. 
 
 The inverse bind matrices, however, seem to be set with the bip and pelvis rotations in place: basically,
 the combined transform matrices, resulting from the existing node matrices and the inverse bind matrices
 yields identity matrices (+- some small error in the translation vector of the order 0.01, i.e. 1cm)
 
 NOTE: when "forcing" these transform matrices to REALLY Id inside the rendering process, it turns out that mesh and joint markers are NOT
 properly aligned anymore. In particular, finger joint markers end up slightly outside the finger geometry.   
   
   
 * For some unclear reasons there are some joint (actually  they are to be seen as end-effectors) that have a transform matrix that 
 incorporates a reflection operation. Example: CWom0023-L_Finger0Nub ( sid=Bone16)          
 Since there is no geometry associated with these bones, the reflection has no real impact, but is annoying anyway.          
 
 * The skeleton structure tree is strange: (Spine is parent of Spine1, but also of L/R_Thigh !!!)
   The weights for Spine show some area AROUND the Pelvis region.
 
 CWom0023-Bip  NOT an official skeleton joint, according to the Collada file. Does not occur among the joints of the skinned mesh.

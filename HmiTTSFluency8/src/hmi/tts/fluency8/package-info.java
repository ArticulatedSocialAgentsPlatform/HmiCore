 * Implementation of TTSGenerator specifically for Fluency8 voices.
* Note: fluency accepts only digits in a sync id, so any charactes are stripped internally. That means that, within a speceh fragment, the sync ids must be unique even after stripping any non-digits; otherwise you'll get feedback for unpredictably the wrong sync
